Actionable Insights from your Lichess games!

To use, visit:  https://jjweimer.shinyapps.io/lichess-dashboard/
Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the app using RStudio.

Note that the Lichess API is limited to 15 games/second, so some querys may take several minutes. The dashboard does come pre-loaded with games of a few well known users to better demonstrate functionality:

- IM Eric Rosen (EricRosen)
- GM Magnus Carlsen (DrDrunkenstein)
- GM Daniel Naroditsky (RebeccaHarris)
- GM Andrew Tang (C9C9C9C9C9)
- GM Hikaru Nakamura (TSMFTXH)
- Joshua Weimer, aka the author of this app (eldiel_prime)
